Runtime System:
[NOTE]  ADVICE  PFC300: The behavior of the DAL watchdog may change on multicore
                systems.
                If a high-priority IEC task on a core displaces all other IEC
                tasks on this core, the BUS is no longer driven into a defined
                state via the watchdog, as the system and therefore other IEC
                tasks on other cores can still be executed.
                For controlled behavior, it is recommended to use the CODESYS
                internal task watchdog.
[FIXED] WAT-34361       Port authentication for the CODESYS WebVisu can be 
                        switched off separately

Fieldbus Interface & Protocols:
[FIXED] WAT-36466       OPC UA Server: Denial of service after several link down
                        for a specific time
[FIXED] WAT-36203       OPC UA Server: Stop publishing if the system time is set
                        backward
[KNOWN] WAT-36971       Writing SNMPUser via WDA-API is only possible with
                        Security Level "AuthPriv

Web Based Management:
[KNOWN] WAT-36520       Mass Storage - Format memory card: If one or more USB
                        sticks are connected to the device, the memory card is
                        not always formatted, but the last connected medium.
                        Workaround: Remove USB stick(s).
